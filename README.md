# SimDSP-Hello
## Basic test of SimDSP for Android

This program includes the minimal source code required to build a basic signal processing application on SimDSP for Android. It reads the input signal and writes the same signal at the output.

To run this program, you need to install SimDSP for Android and the compiler toolchain as described in [SimDSP Project WebSite](https://github.com/parrado/SimDSP-Android). 

Once SimDSP is installed, download or clone this repository, and choose the option *Terminal > Run Build Task* on *VisualStudio Code*.
